		Coding is simply a lot of trial and error. The smallest imperfection or mistake in a huge mass of code can disable the entire thing. Over the past few weeks, I've learned the guiding principles of html: it's a markup language, utilizing starting and end tags to enclose information. Html creates the structure of a website, CSS designs the style, and JavaScript handles the action.

	I feel as if I've done a lot of little bits and pieces here and there. I've set up my website through index.html with links to my project and journal, while separetly working on my people card, and connecting that to my github website. I am anxious to connect it all together, start designing my website full of drawings and art, and learn how to use code to express myself. <br> Terminal is strange, it feels unnatural and foreign, but I need to remember that it is the authentic way to use a computer. Maybe I'll switch to use it more often now that I know what it is.
