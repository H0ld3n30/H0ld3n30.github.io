		Coding is simply a lot of trial and error. The smallest imperfection or mistake in a huge mass of code can disable the entire thing. Over the past few weeks, I've learned the guiding principles of html: it's a markup language, utilizing starting and end tags to enclose information. Html creates the structure of a website, CSS designs the style, and JavaScript handles the action.

	I feel as if I've done a lot of little bits and pieces here and there. I've set up my website through index.html with links to my project and journal, while separetly working on my people card, and connecting that to my github website. I am anxious to connect it all together, start designing my website full of drawings and art, and learn how to use code to express myself. <br> Terminal is strange, it feels unnatural and foreign, but I need to remember that it is the authentic way to use a computer. Maybe I'll switch to use it more often now that I know what it is.

	So my first animation is based off of the skeleton I was given on Classes, except I changed the colors and made it run alternately and a few other things. The most tedious part wasn't actually making the animation, but it was actually linking a new project html to my project page, and making my project page look somewhat aesthetic. For some reason, I thought that doing that would be easier than just making an animation on index, and FYI: it wasn't. Choosing to set it up this way, however, should lay the foundation for future projects and establish a catalog.

		<strong>17th of November - Entry Four</strong><br>

	I'm trying to code a Christmas card for someone, not sure who yet. So I got a snowy gif as a background, and I tried to get an audio file. I even recorded something on guitar band, but none of it worked. I also wanted a santa gif that would appear every time I played the song, but that didn't work either. So, I'm basically stuck. <br><br><strong>Journal 11/22/22</strong><br>
	I fixed it!!!! I just got an audio file off a legit site and copied some code for an if/else switch. Now when I click, the santa pops up and plays 'silent night' instrumental. Idk who I'll give it to yet though.
